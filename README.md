The Sudoku Solver is a Python program that aims to solve the popular Sudoku puzzle game. The program utilizes a backtracking algorithm to fill in empty cells of the puzzle in a recursive manner. The program takes a 9x9 Sudoku grid as input, where each cell contains a number from 1 to 9, or is marked as empty with -1. The solver applies a depth-first search approach to try all possible values for each empty cell until a valid solution is found.

The program consists of several functions that work together to solve the Sudoku puzzle. The "find_empty_space" function scans the grid for empty cells and returns the row and column indices of the first empty cell it finds. The "validity" function checks whether a given value is valid for a given row, column, or sub-grid by comparing it to the values already present in the corresponding row, column, or sub-grid. If the value is found to be valid, it returns True, otherwise, it returns False.

The "solve_sudoku" function is the main function that utilizes the "find_empty_space" and "validity" functions to solve the puzzle. It starts by calling "find_empty_space" to find the first empty cell in the grid. If no empty cells are found, it means that the puzzle has been solved, and the function returns True. Otherwise, the function loops through values 1 to 9 and checks if each value is valid for the empty cell by calling the "validity" function. If a valid value is found, the function assigns the value to the empty cell and makes a recursive call to itself to solve the next empty cell. If the recursive call returns True, the function returns True as well, indicating that the puzzle has been solved. If no valid value is found, or if the recursive call returns False, the function backtracks by setting the current cell back to -1 and tries the next value.

Once the puzzle is solved, the solved grid is printed using the "pprint" function from the pprint module, which prints the grid in a readable format. The program can solve most Sudoku puzzles within a reasonable amount of time and can be used to verify the solutions of manually solved puzzles or to generate new Sudoku puzzles.
